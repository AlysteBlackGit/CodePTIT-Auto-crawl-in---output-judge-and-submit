Welcome back everyone!

After a long week ago, I've decided to learn the next programming language, that was Python. Not only by the brevity and light syntax, but Python also became very useful 
in building Automated Bot by using Selenium lib. This is my first automated bot, which took me 3 nights :)), and it was the accumulation of basic Python that I've learned
it so far.

Let me introduce about my bot:

1. About the purpose:

This is the basic interface of each task in my C++ programming exercises. 

- Firstly, the tests in input data and result in expected output have a lot of empty lines, which can lead to some unexpected errors.

- Secondly, to run test cases in your IDE, we must copy each line of input column in order to make sure that your program run normally. It makes some of us may feel not 
comfortable and sometimes we can miss some lines of input.

- Finally, after our program return the same answer with expected output corresponds with test cases, we submit the code by uploading your file, and wait for judging.

I think it's normal with many people, but on my side, it makes me feel uncomfortable, so I've created a bot that could perform all tasks I need with only a click.
